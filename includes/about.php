    <p><img src="img/about-me-picture-min.jpg" alt="picture of Brian and Nidia Sanchez"></p>
    <p>I'm an up-and-coming web designer, and I currently live in the Salt Lake Valley. I studied Economics at Brigham Young University, and originally discovered my love for coding when working with statistical programming packages (mostly SAS, Stata, and R). Since I was a teenager, I've been fascinated by the fields of web design and development, but just recently decided to follow my passion.</p>
    <p>I spend my days combing through Treehouse and Google to learn new coding skills and brush up on old ones. While I'm not coding, I also love working out and learning new things (currently learning Afrikaans). Right now I'm looking for a development position where I can unleash my creative potential and love for learning.</p>
