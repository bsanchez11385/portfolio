    <p>I'm an up-and-coming web designer, and I currently live in the Salt Lake Valley. I studied Economics at Brigham Young University, but I've been fascinated with web design and development from a young age. I have recently decided to follow my passion and make a living designing and developing websites.</p>
    <p>I spend my days combing through Treehouse and Google to learn new coding skills and brush up on old ones. While I'm not coding, I also love working out, learning new things (I'm currently learning Afrikaans), and watching movies.</p>
