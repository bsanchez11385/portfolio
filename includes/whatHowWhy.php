    <p>I design and develop websites. Every site serves a unique prupose, so why not uniquely design it for that purpose?</p>
    <p>Whether you know exactly what you need, or would like help figuring it out, let me give you a hand&mdash;it's what I do.</p>

    <h1 class="sec-heading">How I Do It</h1>
    <p>This part is simple. Let me know what you're looking for, or we can figure that out together. I'll come up with a game plan and we'll go over it.</p>
    <p>Once you love the plan, the real fun begins. I'll keep you updated along the way, and soon you'll have a web presence to be proud of.</p>

    <h1 class="sec-heading">Why I Do It</h1>
    <p>Because I love it! There are always multiple things someone can do, and do quite well. But when you do something you LOVE, it's a whole other ball game.</p>
    <p>Long hours become enjoyable, tough problems become exciting puzzles, and "hard work" is something you now look forward to.</p>
    <p>It brings me great joy to be able to take an idea, vision, or a concept, and make it a reality. I absolutely love doing this!</p>
