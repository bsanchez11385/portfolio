    <h1 class="sec-heading">Goal</h1>
    <p>I want to make a living creating. Whether by websites that are beautifully designed to be effective and efficient, useful mobile applications that make life easier and more productive, or simply something pleasant to look at, I want to design, create, and code.</p>

    <h1 class="sec-heading">Plan</h1>
    <p>My plan is to always continue learning. Luckily, digging through books (...google) is one of the things I enjoy most.</p>
    <p>I want to work with a company where I can truly show my worth. I work hard but I also love efficiency, so I plan to make myself invaluable by not just learning enough to excel at what I do, but make others' jobs easier for them as well.</p>

    <h1 class="sec-heading">Motivation</h1>
    <p>What's more motivating than doing something you love?! If I can make my living doing something I look forward to doing every single day, something on which I'm more than happy to spend longer hours, you can bet I'll be motivated to do the best and be the best possible.</p>
